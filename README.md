### TODO:
[ ] removing query to emtpy one does not reset the serach after the 1 char left.

[ ] enter submits the comand and saves it into .config files

[ ] add the build binary to my paths so I can start using it on the laptop

[ ] create a configuration object that sets the storage path (I want to add it to synology to share across computers)


### DONE
[-] remove duplicates from the history


--- 

### Why?
I wanted to get more familiar with command line tools, but I don't use new commands enough to learn them and remember then. Thus, this tool has a few things that solves this prolem:
- You can find and select the command from history
- It will store this reference in an `.md` file so it can be changed within a text editor (TODO)
- When you have a free time, you can flashcard these commands with command name and then description shown afterwards (TODO)

This way, I can stay in the command line, learn new less common commands and avoid using google. 
Also, I can commit this to git repo for future reference and easy laoding on a different computer.

Additional features:
- Add a command manually without the history search (TODO)
- ...
